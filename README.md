Week 9 Challenge

## Entity Relationship Diagram
The first step to understand employment at Pewlett Hackard in the 1980s and 1990s is to look at the structure of the data received. We received data on employees, including ID number, first name, last name, sex, title, birth date, hire date, salary, and department in which each employee worked. If the employee was a manager of a department, that was also provided in the data. Each employee was the manager for at most one department and had at most one salary and title. However, employees may have been an employee at multiple departments. You can explore more in the Entity Relationship Diagram provided below.
